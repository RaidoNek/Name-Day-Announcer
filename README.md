Download libraries via vcpkg. (json, cpr).
I really recommend using it as an auto-start executable file(on windows start)

How to use?
1) Select country, if your country is missing, please contact me.
2) You will be asked to enter an hour and a minute. Simply enter it in 0-24 format, not in AM/PM. If u will enter 18h 0m, its the same as 6PM 0m
3) Enjoy announcement
